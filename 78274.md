# Sue loves walks

One time she walked north all the way from the center of Sheffield to Chapeltown, then down to Grenoside.

The second time she started from just south of Glossop, then followed the national park boundry to the right and around, then north. But before she got to Devil's Elbow, she went east and got a cup of tea and a scone.

The last walk started at Royston, she went south, turned left, found a nice nature reserve. She stopped in Shafton for a quick cuppa, walked up the railway but hopped off and went through Ellis Laithe and back to Royston.
