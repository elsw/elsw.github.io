# Jackie loves walks

One time she walked all the way from the center of sheffeild north to Chapeltown, then down to grenoside

The 2nd time started in just south of Glossop, then followed the national park boundry to the right and around, then north. but before she got to devil's elbow, she went east and got a cup of tea and a scone.

The last walk started at royston, she went south, turned left, found a nice nature reserve. Stopped in shafton for a quick cuppa, walked up the railway but hopped off and went through ellis laithe and back to royston.

After all was done she red a book.
